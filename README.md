JBlockchain by Jerry Decker

This is my implementation of a basic blockchain utilizing JSON imports/exports with the rapidJSON library,
and SHA-256 hashing with the picosha library. 

This project was for my CS210 class at Bradley University. Here I was able to gain experience using the following:
  Blockchain Basics (Validation, Block Structure, Linking)
  Data Structures (Unordered Maps, Vectors)
  Hashing functions (SHA256)
  JSON Parsing
  Basic Error Checking
  Code Organization
  
  I would like to give a big shout out to my professor David Brennan at Bradley University for a practical yet challenging project that I
  was able to complete in time but was also able to learn from.
